Enforcement Profiles document information about the purpose, the
implementation, and the technology behind rule enforcement. With this
information, business and technical users can easily understand how
rules are enforced and the impact rules have on the business. The
profiles accommodate different types of rules: rules that are
automatically enforced via enforcement technology (for example, the
DSP®), rules that are enforced via manual tasks, and rules that are not
enforced but require documentation. Enforcement Profiles contain the
following components to help users document relevant information about
rule enforcement:

-   **Opportunities**---Describe an intent of the rule. Each rule may
    have multiple enforcement opportunities.
-   **Methods**---Determine how an opportunity and a technology work
    together to audit, execute and report on rule enforcement.
-   **Applications**--- The technology used to enforce rules; the
    enforcement engine.

The methods and applications used for each rule depend on the rule
enforcement's opportunity or purpose. For steps on how to add
Enforcement Profiles for each opportunity, click the following links:

-   [Archiving]{#Archiving .popUpLink}---Documents rule enforcement as
    part of a data archival or a retention process.
-   [Governance]{#Governance .popUpLink}---Documents rule enforcement
    through Data Governance, such as Master Data Management via the
    dspConduct method when using the DSP as the enforcement application.
-   [Interfacing]{#Interfacing .popUpLink}---Documents rule enforcement
    during data movement between platforms via an ETL tool, iPaaS or
    message bus.
-   [Migration]{#Migration .popUpLink}---Documents rule enforcement
    during transition to a new platform using the dspMigrate method when
    using the DSP as the enforcement application.
-   [Quality]{#Quality .popUpLink}---Documents rule enforcement through
    monitoring and remediation via the dspMonitor method when using DSP
    as the enforcement application.
